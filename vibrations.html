<h1 class="center">Physics of Vibrations Intro</h1>

<p>Sound travels in sine and cosine waves. Their vibrations cause variations in air pressure, which in turn allows us to hear their sound by vibrating our ear drums. A crude formula for the vibrations caused in our ear by sound over time is e^-5t * sin(2pi*f*t), where t represents the time passed in seconds and f represents the frequency of the vibration. The frequency is the main determinant of what will make different noises sound different. For some context, if two notes are an octave apart, then the higher note’s frequency will be twice the other’s.</p>

<figure class="center"><img src="440 v 880 440.jpg" width="650" height="300"  alt="440 hz vs 880 hz"><figcaption><i>This graph compares the frequency of a 440 hz sound wave to an 880 hz sound wave.</i></figcaption></figure>

<p>The two notes represented by the sine waves above are therefore an octave apart. This picture demonstrates why notes separated by an octave sound similar to each other: as seen by how well their graphs line up (it should be noted that wherever the red 440 hz graph is shown on the graph, the 880 hz graph exists as well, as shown below), the vibrations that they create overlap so well they cause us to hear similar sounds.</p>

<figure><img src="440 v 880 880.jpg" width="650" height="300" class="center" alt="440 hz vs 880 hz"><figcaption><i>Here, we can see all of the blue 880 hz graph and how well it lines up with the red 440 hz graph. Using the 440 hz graph from above, we can find that the blue and red graphs intersect at the x-axis every 0.001136 seconds!</i></figcaption></figure>
