<p>Just as how notes separated by an octave blend together well due to the simple ratio of their frequencies, notes whose ratios of frequencies can simplify to have low numbers in the numerator and denominator tend to combine to make a pleasant sound. When notes harmonize in this way, they are said to be consonant.</p1>

<figure><img src="440 v 660 660.jpg" width="650" height="300" class="center" alt="440 hz vs 660 hz"><figcaption><i>As seen by comparing these two graphs (the first with the 440 hz graph on top and the second with the 660 hz graph on top), each “line” that is independent rather than in one of the groups of three on the graph exists on both functions, meaning the graphs of these vibrations intersect at the y-axis approximately every 0.002273 seconds.</i></figcaption></figure>

<p>Although consonance often sounds soothing, composers often hope to create tension in their music. It is in these situations that dissonance, or a lack of harmony between notes, is preferred to consonance for its ability to create contrast and emotion. Dissonance is created when notes’ ratios of frequencies cannot be simplified to have low numbers in the numerator and denominator.</p1>

<figure><img src="440 v 450.jpg" width="650" height="300" class="center" alt="440 hz vs 450 hz"><figcaption><i>Whereas previous graphs we looked at intersected at the x-axis many times in our single screenshot, we only see the graphs for 440 hz and 450 hz sound waves intersect when x=0.</i></figcaption></figure>

<p>The reason that different instruments make different sounds even when playing the same notes is because when instruments play a note, they not only play that frequency but also play overtones which introduce other frequencies to their sounds. For example, a piano’s sound is dominated by its fundamental tone, whereas a flute’s first harmonic overtone is louder than its fundamental tone.</p>
