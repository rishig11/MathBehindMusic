<h1 class="center">The Math Behind Music</h1>

<p>Mathematics play a key role in the composition of music. For example, despite the unlimited range of frequencies within an octave that can produce unique pitches, we strategically only use twelve equally spaced notes because these notes efficiently provide a large combination of pleasant chords. Thanks to the equal amount of space, called a semitone, between each of the twelve notes, composers can create captivating melodies and chords by spacing their piece’s notes by certain semitone intervals. </p>

<p>Additionally, keeping time in music depends heavily on music's mathematical foundation. Whether it comes in the form of the various time signatures or the unique rhythms that songs have to offer, math serves as the main component in what it takes to hold a steady and engaging beat.</p>

<p>Due to my interest in both music and math, I decided that I would further research their relationship so that I could ultimately make my own composition using what I learned. Specifically, I delved deeper into how I could use math to develop ideas in melodies, chords, and rhythms that I otherwise could not have. Before tackling these concepts, however, I decided to familiarize myself with the side of math in music with which I had much less experience: the physics of sound waves themselves. Through this venture, I hoped I would develop a stronger basis for studying the other topics and potentially come across other information that could help me with my composition.</p>
