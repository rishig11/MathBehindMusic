<p>My main takeaway from my research was that math serves as a method to create music that would have been difficult to come up with otherwise. I used this idea as much as possible when making my own composition, allowing me to make much more deliberate and innovative musical decisions than I would have before my research. Below I have described how I made these choices throughout my song.</p>

<p>0:00 I start off my composition’s melody with parts that will reappear in some form throughout the song, whether that be in a different key or a different tempo. I keep the background simple to begin with but will build on it throughout the first second.</p>

<p>0:22 Here, I add another element to the background: another piano line that plays a simple loop of C and D. Just as how I eased into the melody in the first eight measures, I wanted to start off simply with my second piano line so that I could build upon it throughout the section. Throughout the piece, I decided to use loops that had well-formedness as opposed to perfect balance because I wanted to try more erratic beats and because I preferred having a hierarchy to my beat levels: a percussion baseline, a melodic baseline, and varying rhythmic patterns underneath that range from piano chords to quick flute phrases.</p>

<p>0:41 From this point, the melody becomes less structured so that I can introduce new ideas now that the song has had a chance to establish itself. Similarly, I allow the second piano line to play more notes to support the more varied melody. Finally, I introduce a flute, which is quickly joined by another flute after four measures so that they can create chords together. I chose to use the flute as an extra background instrument because of how its harmonic tone contrasts the more basic, grounded tone of the piano.</p>

<p>1:04 To prepare for an upcoming jump in tempo, I begin transition the first section from a laid-back passage to a more exciting one. To accomplish this, I have the flute play different versions of a quick, sixteenth note based phrase. Additionally, I add bongos. Keeping with the spirit of math and creativity, I made my beat loop with the idea in mind that as the loop progresses, the beat’s notes will have less space between them, alluding to how an increase in tempo approaches.</p>

<p>1:26 I continue preparing this section for the tempo change by building on the previous measures’ melody and making it more dramatic, adding hig
