<h1 class="center">Rhythms</h1>

<p>Although all forms of rhythm involve mathematics, mathematics can play an especially large role in the creation of rhythmic loops. Captivating rhythms can be created by inserting polygons inside of a circle: the circle acts as a clockwise loop that will be repeated, and each vertex of inserted polygons demonstrates a note that should be played at that point in the loop (Milne and Herff).</p>

<figure><img src="loop.png" width="100" height="100" class="center" alt="basic rhythmic loop"><figcaption><i>This picture of a diamond inside of a circle indicates that four equally spaced beats occur per loop. If the loop lasts for a four-beat measure, then this rhythm would play four quarter notes per measure.</i></figcaption></figure>

<p>Oftentimes, rhythmic loops are multilevel, meaning that different instruments’ loops may coincide at certain points. However, in certain genres, such as Latin percussion, it is ideal to not have any rhythmic intersections. This rhythmic model allows for an incredible amount of rhythms: even if only sixteen note locations and a maximum of just three levels can intersect, there are more than seventeen trillion different possible loops that could be made. However, there are two mathematical categories that dictate which of these potential rhythms are of musical interest: well-formedness and perfect balance (Milne and Herff).</p>

<p>A loop falls has well-formedness when it has four general qualities: each rhythmic levels only contains around one or two distinct beat lengths, each rhythmic level has beats that are fairly evenly spaced in time, there are no sudden gaps in the loop, and the rhythmic levels are hierarchical. Rhythmic levels are hierarchical when there is a slow, dominant level that is split apart a faster and weaker level, which in turn would be split by an even faster and weaker level, and so on for however many rhythmic levels there are (Milne and Herff).</p>

<p>Alternatively, a loop has perfect balance when its levels are not hierarchical and when two or more of its levels have evenly space beats that are superimposed. Additionally, all levels of the beats tend to coincide at a single location. Geometrically, loops of perfect balance are generally made with combinations of regular polygons, and the average position of all the beat locations is at the center of the circle (hence the name of perfect balance; Milne and Herff).</p>
