<h1 class="center">Analysis of Transposition and Inversion in Fugue by Bach</h1>

<p>A fugue is a type of composition in which a short phrase, called the subject, is introduced at one part of the song and then interwoven into the rest of the song in various forms. To keep the song from becoming repetitive, many mathematical measures can be taken. Here, we will examine Fugue by Bach to see how it uses the transposition and inversion functions we previously discussed to create an engaging song.</p>

<p>The song introduces its subject of 	&lt;D, E, F, G, E, F, D, C#, D, Bb, G, A&gt;, which equals &lt;2, 4, 5, 7, 4, 5, 2, 1, 2, 10, 7, 9&gt; when using the semitone numbering system where C=0, in measure 1. To help with notation of the transposition and inversion functions used in the rest of the song, we will call this original subject P (Fiore).</p>

<p>Bach uses this melody until measure 3, in which he uses another phrase: &lt;A, B, C, D, B, C, A, G#, A, F, D, E&gt; = &lt;9, 11, 0, 2, 11, 0, 9, 8, 9, 5, 2, 4&gt;. Comparing these semitone values to those from the subject, we can see that each one is seven semitones above the original. Thus, Bach transposed P up by seven semitones, which we will notate as the phrase T7P (T for transpose, 7 for the number of semitones we transposed by, and P for the subject). In measure 6, Bach returns to the subject, but this time it is an octave lower  (Fiore). </p>

<p>At measure 8, a new form of the subject enters: &lt;E, F, G, A, F, Bb, G, F#, G, Eb, C#, D&gt; = &lt;4, 5, 7, 9, 5, 10, 7, 6, 7, 3, 1, 2&gt;. The first five notes of this phrase are the respective notes of T2P, but the next five are the respective notes of T5P. The final note does not match that of either of these phrases (Fiore).</p>

<p>At measure 13, the phrase from measure 3 (T7P) is repeated, but with a small variation: namely, the third and sixth notes are both increased by a half step, switching from C to C# (Fiore). </p>

<p>At measure 14, we have the phrase &lt;E, D, C#, B, D, C#, E, F, E, A, C, Bb&gt; = &lt;4, 2, 1, 11, 2, 1, 4, 5, 4, 9, 0, 10&gt; , whose first eight notes match those of I6P (inversion of P transposed upward by six semitones; Fiore).</p>

<p>In measures 17, 18, and 21, we have three more versions of T7P, each of which have their own minor variations. At measure 22, we have another variation of I6P, which is like the version in measure 14 in that all but its last three notes match I6P  (Fiore).</p>

<p>Just from these first twenty-two measures, we can observe how the transposition and inversion functions play a large role in keeping Fugue by Bach’s structure without risking monotony: they add more flavor and tension to the song’s main idea while remaining familiar and true to this idea. Impressively, Bach uses transposition and inversion functions of his subject P as the blueprint for his entire fugue.</p>
