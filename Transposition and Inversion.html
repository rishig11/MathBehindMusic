<p>Given a set of notes in mod 12, a transposition function adds or subtracts from the semitone values of all the notes in the set. For example, if we were to transpose the C major chord down by three half-steps, the notes C (0), E (4), and G (7) would be converted to -3 mod 12, 1 mod 12, and 4 mod 12, resulting in the A major chord: A (9), C# (1), and E (4).</p>

<p>An inversion function takes the notes in a set and multiplies their semitone values by negative one. This would change the C major chord’s semitone values to 0 mod 12, -4 mod 12, and -7 mod 12, converting the notes to C (0), G# (8), and F (5) and creating the F minor (F, G#, C) chord progression. An inversion function may also transpose the resulting function afterward. Transposition and inversion can introduce variety to a song while also helping it maintain structure: although they do change the notes that are played, transposition does not affect the intervals between notes, and even inversion maintains some of them. Additionally, in the case of melodies, transpositions and inversions can be applied without altering the melody’s rhythm, allowing them to preserve even more of their familiarity.</p>
