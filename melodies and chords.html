<h1 class="center">Notes Intro: Modular Arithmetic</h1>

<p>Unfortunately, there is no formula that can tell us exactly what sounds good and bad. However, mathematics can help introduce musical ideas that would have been difficult to arrive at otherwise. Before we examine two functions that can bring greater variety to note structures, specifically melodies and chords, an understanding of modular arithmetic and its use in music will be helpful.</p>

<p>Modular arithmetic involves looking at a numberâ€™s remainder when it is divided by a certain number rather than just the number itself. For example, 17 modulo (or mod for short) 12 = 5, because when 17 is divided by 12, there is a remainder of 5 (in this situation, the number 12 acts as the modulus, or the divisor). Because there are twelve semitones that loop into each other, modular arithmetic can be used to express each note. For example, if we use a certain octave of C as a baseline, we could express its semitone value as 0. This would make C# have a value of 1, D have a value of 2, D# have a value of 3, and so on until the next octave of C, which would have a value of 12. However, this continuous number system fails to express how after every twelve notes, the notes repeat themselves in a higher octave. </p>

<p>We can use a modulus of 12 to instead communicate the generally more useful knowledge of the note itself rather than how many semitones higher or lower it is than an arbitrary baseline. Say that our 17 from before represents a certain note that is 17 semitones above our baseline C. It is much easier to determine what note this 17 represents by calculating 17 mod 12 = 5 and then counting five half-steps up from C to F rather than having to count seventeen of them to obtain the same result. It should be noted that modular arithmetic also works for negative numbers. For instance, if a note has a semitone value of -10 according to our scale with some octave of C = 0, we could perform -10 modulo 12 = 2 to quickly find that this note is a D.</p>
